Bonding Period is Over
======================

The last week has officially been the so-called "community bonding
period". I used it to get more familiar with the codebase, hang around on
#astropy and follow the development via the mailinglist and the updates of
the astroquery repository at GitHub. My next plans are:

    - to finally finish my started pull request to switch from the library
      lxml to BeautifulSoup.

    - to fix the `issue #49`_

Today I will have a hangout with my mentor Adam Ginsburg to discuss the
next steps and how to implement them. At least that's what I imagine,
actually we only arranged a time for a hangout.

.. _`issue #49`: https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/issues/49
